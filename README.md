# TRAFFIC Coursework
#### Achieved a strong distinction - 77% 
Added functionality to the backend of a traffic counting website, where users manually add various vehicle types and occupancy. Undo entry function, download CSV function, SQL injection protection (not part of spec, but I wanted to challenge myself). The coursework essentially required us to transform data from the SQL database, clean it and format it as per the specifications.

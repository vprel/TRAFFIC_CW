# Traffic counting coursework
#### Achieved a strong distinction - 77% 
Added functionality to the backend of a traffic counting website, where users manually add various vehicle types and occupancy. Undo entry function, download CSV function, SQL injection protection (not part of spec, but I wanted to challenge myself). The coursework essentially required us to transform data from the SQL database, clean it and format it as per the specifications. \
\
Helped strengthen backend development skills, data handling, validation practices and practised secure coding and database interactions. \
\
To run the website: \
Make sure you are running the server_ANS.py script inside of the InitialRelease directory. \
python server_ANS.py [port_number] \
http://localhost:[port_number] \
test username: test1 \
test password: password1 \
